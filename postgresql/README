DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages postgresql.
It's based on Example42's modules with some cleanups and removal of unused classes.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the postgresql::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/postgresql/manifests/params.pp). Here you can:
- Set defaults for the variables
- Validate and filter Users variables
- Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes

Customizations for different projects/customers should be placed in 
separated "project" modules.
