Puppet module: vagrant

DESCRIPTION:
This module installs and manages vagrant.
It's based on Example42's module structure and features standard and
extended classes for automatic monitoring, backup and firewalling.

All the variables used in this module are defined in the vagrant::params class
(File: $MODULEPATH/vagrant/manifests/params.pp). Here you can:
- Set default settings and filtering module's specific Users variables
- Add selectors for internal variables to adapt the module to different OSes
- Review and eventually change default settings for variables that affect the
  Example42 extended classes.

Customizations for different projects and logic on how to populate configuration
files should be placed in the $my_project classes.


MODULE'S SPECIFIC USER VARIABLES:


USAGE:
# Standard Classes 
include vagrant              # Installs vagrant as gem

include vagrant::absent      # Remove vagrant package.
include vagrant::debug       # Used for debugging purposes (not resource hungry)
                         # Automatically included if $debug=yes
                         # Requires Example42's puppet::params and puppet::debug

# Extended Classes
include vagrant::puppi   # Puppi extensions for the vagrant module
                         # Requires Example42's puppi module



EXAMPLE42 GENERAL VARIABLES:
Example42 modules collection uses some general variables that can influence the
behaviour of this module. You can happily live without considering or setting them,
but they can be useful to get many useful features out of the box.
$my_project - If set, permits you to alter and customize the module behaviour
  and files's deploy logic in custom project classes
  The custom class vagrant::$my_module autoloads from MODULEPATH/vagrant/manifests/$my_project.pp
  but you can place it in a separated module by explicitely importing it:
  "import $my_project" to have something like MODULEPATH/$my_project/manifests/vagrant.pp
$base_source - Lets you define an alternative source for static files:
  - $base_source not set -> Files are looked in puppet://$servername/ (the PuppetMaster)
  - $base_source set -> Files are in $base_source ( Ex: puppet://$servername/$my_module ) 
  Note that the module automatically manages the different paths for Puppet pre 0.25
$debug - If set to yes writes in /var/lib/puppet/debug/ useful debugging info

VARIABLES FOR EXTENDED MODULES:
$puppi - Set to "yes" to enable vagrant plugins for puppi
Check vagrant/manifests/puppi.pp for more info.



DEPENDENCIES:
Standard classes generally don't need external modules.
Extended classes need the relevant external modules.
vagrant::conf generic infile configuration define needs the Example42 "common" module
